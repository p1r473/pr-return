# Plugin for ZSH that displays the return value of the last command run

This plugin will create a global variable that can be displayed in prompts. 

### Example

```sh
PROMPT='$pr_return ...REST OF PROMPT'
```

This plugin is made to be fast. It runs in the background and updates information only when needed.

## Prerequisites

#### This plugin depends on [zsh-colors](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/colors) and [zsh-figures](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/figures).

If you don't use [zpm](https://github.com/zpm-zsh/zpm), install it manually and activate it before this plugin. 
If you use zpm you donâ€™t need to do anything

## Installation
